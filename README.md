# Puzzle Color Tiles

On the screen you see a field of 4x4 cells. Each cell can be light or dark in color. When you click on a cell, all cells located on the same horizontal and vertical lines change color to the opposite one. At the beginning of the game, the tiles have a random color (dark or light). The goal of the game is to bring the tiles to the same color.
